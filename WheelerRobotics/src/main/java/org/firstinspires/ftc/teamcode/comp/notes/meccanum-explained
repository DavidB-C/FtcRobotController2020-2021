Meccanum Explained


Here are vectors for each wheel, it's all relative, so the ones mean at max power.
The average of all the wheels is the direction the robot goes if the diags are the same.

if the wheels vectors add up to 0, this causes stationary spinning to occur

otherwise, using disconnected value for the wheel groups of bl fr and br fl then you can engineer circular motion causing the robot to travel around a curve


vectors in format x, y

back left:
    forwards: -1, 1
    backwards: 1, -1

back right:
    forwards: 1, 1
    backwards: -1, -1

front left:
    forwards: -1, 1
    backwards: 1, -1

front right:
    forwards: 1, 1
    backwards: -1, -1


-1 to 1 and -1 to 1
-1 to 1 and 1 to -1


group 1 = br & fl
group 2 = bl & fr


y  =  g2/2  +  g1/2
g2 = 2y - g1
g1 = 2y - g2


x  =  -g2/2  +  g1/2
g2 = g1 - 2x
g1 = 2x + g2

turn x degrees

THIS ISN'T TOTALLY CORRECT
